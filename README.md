## Arfin Portfolio 

## Description

This is my first attempt at making a personal portfolio webpage which contains all the projects I have recently created or worked on. This will be updated as I develop more skills and projects.

I have always been drawn to analytical problems and coding has allowed me to apply that to actual problems


## Usage 

Here is the wireframe of the webpage that was made before it was created:
